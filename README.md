# Ray-Tracing Lab Project
Ray-Tracing is a C++ code that you can use to generate photorealistic images.

## Getting started
Clone the source folder to your build tree, then compile the code using [`CMake`](https://cmake.org/) in a building directory. You can simply follow the instructions below.
``` sh
$ git clone https://github.com/federicopellegatta/raytracing.git
$ cd raytracing && mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
You will find tests and executable files in `build` directory. 

Ray-Tracing is tested using [`CMake`](https://cmake.org/) v3.16.3 and C++17 compiler.
